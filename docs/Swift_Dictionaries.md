# Swift Dictionaries Documentation

Dictionaries store associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. Each value in a dictionary is associated with its unique key. For instance, Tempe is located in Arizona. This key acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary. To look up values within a dictionary you need to look up the values based on the identifier. Thus, for the case described above, we would use Arizona to find the city Tempe. 

The type of a Swift dictionary is written as a Dictionary \<Key, Value\>, where key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key and Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.

A shorthand form for a dictionary is written as [Key: Value]. Although those two forms are identical the Swift 5 documentation recommends using the shorthand form.
