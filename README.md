## About

Learn how to code iOS applications and the inner-workings of iOS developments with Swift 5 programming. 

The general layout of the documentation is by projects beginning at introduction to small applications. The docs folder is what explains the inner-workings of the Swift 5 langauge and how to use different commands and semantics.

## Docs

The docs directory is where all information on how to code with Swift 5 will be stored. This information will be aligned by certain objects or how to do conditional statements with Swift 5. The layout will be in forms like how to use buttons, text fields etc. as well as doing certain loops. Those documents are outlined below.

**There is currently no written documentation on coding with Swift 5**

## Projects

The projects that are made are written with a combined combination of Storyboards and Swift 5. The former has since become outdated (2023) and will not be used as much as Swift 5. The languages used in each project will be defined in the description.

Description: This first project uses both Swift5 and Storyboard programming to create a simple application that takes in a name and outputs a greeting. This simple application is great at teaching the first use of text boxes as well as taking user inuput and changing text of the applications within run-time. Overall a great first project for those starting with XCode programming.

### BMI Calculator

Description: This bmi calculator was coded just using Swift 5. The calculator is a good first use of mathematical functions and creating an app using user input. This application is broken into two sections:

1. Text Input Calculator

This calculator uses text input from the user and then calculates their estimated BMI. The main issue with this project is being able to take user input and convert to a double value. This double value is then what is used for calculations.

2. Slider Input Calculator

This second calculator accomplishes the same function as the first project but uses slider input that continuously checks our equation to notify the user of their BMI.
